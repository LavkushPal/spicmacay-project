          The activities conducted by the Chapter not only highlighted the
          diversity of Indian arts but also created interactive platforms for
          the campus community to engage directly with the art forms. Events
          like the Virasat festival were particularly notable for showcasing the
          talent of artists from across the nation, emphasizing the Chapter's
          role in enriching the campus's cultural fabric.
